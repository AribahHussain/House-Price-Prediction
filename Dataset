The dataset used for this project is the House Price Prediction Dataset 🏡, which is available on Kaggle 📦. It includes key housing features such as Price, Area (in sq. ft), Number of Bedrooms 🛏️, Bathrooms 🚿, and Location 📍. This structured dataset enables meaningful regression analysis to predict property prices. The categorical Location variable was converted into numerical format using one-hot encoding, making it suitable for machine learning models. Its diversity in housing attributes helps capture both linear and non-linear patterns in pricing. This Kaggle-hosted dataset is perfect for learners and developers aiming to apply supervised learning in real estate prediction 📊🔍.
