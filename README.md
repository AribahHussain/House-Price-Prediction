# House-Price-Prediction
This project predicts house prices based on features like area, bedrooms, bathrooms, and location. It compares Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting models. After preprocessing and evaluation, Gradient Boosting showed higher accuracy, making it better for capturing complex housing price patterns.
